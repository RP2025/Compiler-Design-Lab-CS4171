## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup & Compilation Instructions

To compile and execute Lex and Yacc files used in these assignments, follow the steps below.

```bash
# üìã Prerequisites
# Ensure the following tools are installed on your system:
# Install Yacc and Lex
sudo apt install bison flex
# Install GCC, the standard GNU compiler for C language

# 1. Generate Yacc Output
# Compile the Yacc file (yacc_file.y) to produce y.tab.c and y.tab.h files
yacc -d yacc_file.y

# 2. Generate Lex Output
# Compile the Lex file (lex_file.l) to produce lex.yy.c
lex lex_file.l

# 3. Compile with GCC
# Combine the generated .c files using GCC to create the executable
gcc lex.yy.c y.tab.c -o output

# 4. Run the Executable
# Execute the compiled program with a test file (e.g., test.c)
./output test.c
